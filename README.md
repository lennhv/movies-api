# MOVIES API

A django REST API using
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/">DRF (Django Rest Framework)</a><br/>
<p>DRF is an amazing library for creating REST APIs in an easy way and it is also well documented, I think it is the most popular and you can configure and customize many things to suit your needs. </p>
<p>Generic views and predefined serializers boost your productivity cutting the coding  time.</p>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/axnsan12/drf-yasg">drf-yasg (Yet another Swagger generator)</a>
<p>Documenting an API can be a difficult task, but using drf-yasg it becomes a configuration, basically you only need to configure the view to show the documentation and the URLs where they will be accessed. Obviusly you could customize more thing but basic configuration rocks </p>
